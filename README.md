# Rust bindings to OpenJPEG
This crate provides access to OpenJPEG's JPEG2000 decoder.

## Warning
Please be advised that using C code means this crate is likely vulnerable to various memory exploits, e.g. see [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-8332](CVE-2016-8332) for an actual example from the past.

As soon as someone writes an efficient JPEG2000 decoder in pure Rust you should probably switch over to that.

## License
You can use the Rust code in the directories `src` and `openjp2-sys/src` under the terms of either the MIT license (`LICENSE-MIT` file) or the Apache license (`LICENSE-APACHE` file). Please note that this will link statically to OpenJPEG, which has its own license which you can find at `openjp2-sys/libopenjpeg/LICENSE` (you might have to check out the git submodule first).
